# Working with Git

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basic concepts and design features that underline the Git architecture
- Analyze how git works with binary blobs and checksummed content rather than files and pathnames as the basic objects
- Explain the differences between committing and publishing, and upstream and downstream repositories
- Understand how git categorizes files and use the basic git file commands
- Understand how branches are created and used, and how to get earlier project versions
- Delineate differences between branches, and earlier stages in the project
- Merge branches back into each other to incorporate revisions
