# Git and Git Installation

## Learning Objectives

- Explain why Revision Control Systems are essential to efficient development strategies
- Explore the evolution of revision control systems up through Git, and enumerate current choices
- Explain the special needs of distributed development projects like the Linux kernel
- List the graphical interfaces that exist for git
- Demonstrate how you can get help and documentation within git itself
- Install Git on all operating systems and see a simple example of basic git operations
- Show how to convert projects from other systems, such as CVS and Subversion, to and from Git
