# STARTING TO WORK IN LINUX

## Learning Objectives

- List the main text editors available on virtually any Linux-based system, concentrating on vi, emcas, nano and gedit
- Understand how to use vi and emacs editors and how to create files with just cat and echo and no editor
- Discuss how the operating system employs command shells, the choices available, and how bash is initialized
- Explain the use of aliases, manipulate and use environment variables, and customize the command line prompt
- Discuss special characters, and understand how to use them, as well as to override their special meaning
- Use redirection for input, output, and error messages, and use command substitution to feed the output of one program to another
- Employ pipes to let connected programs run in parallel efficiently for better utilization of system resources
- Discuss the main directory structures used in Linux and their purposes
- Describe how partitions are used and how to construct, format, and manipulate them, and how to establish good partitioning schemes
