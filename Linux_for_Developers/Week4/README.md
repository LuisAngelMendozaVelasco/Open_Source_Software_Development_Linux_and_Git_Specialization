# Command Details

## Learning Objectives

- Delineate the important commands and utilities present on Linux systems
- Use the main command line utilities for monitoring system performance, memory usage, and I/O and network activity
- Use gnome-system monitor and ksysguard for graphical performance monitoring
- Discuss the role of kernel modules and how to load and unload them dynamically
- Discuss how udev works to handle changes in system hardware and load device drivers at runtime
- Use systemctl to start and stop services and enable or disable their launch at boot
