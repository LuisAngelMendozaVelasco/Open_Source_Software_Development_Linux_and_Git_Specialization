# System Components

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how the system boots, the role of GRUB and the contents of the /boot directory
- Discuss the next steps of launching essential functions using systemd and its predecessors, SysVinit and Upstart
- Kill the graphical desktop interface and enter a pure text-based terminal
- Analyze memory usage and the role of swap space, and how the system reacts to running out of memory
- Discuss how the system works with network devices and how they are identified and named
- Configure and bring up or down network interfaces and networks
