# Command Line Tools

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the basic utility programs for listing, creating, renaming files and other basic file operations
- Use find to locate files in given locations, and locate to find files throughout the system
- Use grep to identify lines in files which contain certain strings and sed to edit files in a streaming fashion
- Display and append to file contents using cat and echo
- Edit and print file contents using sed and awk, and learn to use multiple other utilities for file and text manipulation
- Execute bash scripts and specify arguments that they operate on, and how to use debugging options
- Use looping and conditional constructs in multiple ways, and learn the case switching construct
- Run tests on file properties, string comparisons, and arithmetic expressions, and learn how to use functions (subprograms) inside scripts
